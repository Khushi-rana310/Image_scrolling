I'm excited to share my latest project - Image Slider 

Some key features of an image slider like this include:
Using HTML to structure the image elements in a container
Applying CSS to style the images, set their dimensions, and position them side-by-side
Leveraging CSS transitions to make the images smoothly scroll left or right
Adding JavaScript to automate the scrolling, such as by using setInterval() to move the images at a set interval
